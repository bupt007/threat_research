Ongoing attack from Hong Kong targeting SSH servers on the open Internet. Attacks started at the end of November 2014 and are still going through early December 2014.

```
(the sorting is kind of weird because multiple machines are using the same wordlist, and I have a bunch of honeypots)

*hkgroup_passwords_sorted.txt* includes all password attempts. The file contains roughly 26,000 unique passwords.
